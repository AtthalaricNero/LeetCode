# Leetcode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to selected LeetCode problems.

I use this repo to:
- strengthen logical and structural problem solving
- practice recognizing algorithmic patterns
- keep my coding skill sharp through regular practice

The focus is not on solving as many problems as possible, but on understanding the core ideas, edge cases and reasoning behind each solutions.

Solutions are organized by topic to highlight recurring patterns across different problems.
